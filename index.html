            I find myself writing to you in the wee hours of the morning, laughing like a maniac for reasons I can't quite fathom. It's 3:47 AM, and my mind is a bit of a jumble, but the happiness I'm feeling right now is too infectious to ignore. Why, you ask? Well, it turns out creating a small website at this ungodly hour is the source of my inexplicable joy.
            
           <br><br> I can't help but marvel at your name, Laveena. Whoever chose that name for you must have been a genius or, perhaps, a time traveler. It suits you so perfectly that it feels like the universe crafted it exclusively for you. I catch myself thinking, "God, take away all her sorrows, and if you must, replace them with my own. I'd willingly trade my 100% happiness for her 100% sadness. After all, how could you be so cruel as to make a girl like her cry?"
            
           <br><br> Our chats, Laveena, are like a magical recharge for my soul. A mere 10 minutes with you leaves me motivated for the next 24 hours, ready to embrace life's challenges. It's as if you infuse me with energy, sparking a desire to eat healthier, work out, explore the culinary world, delve into business research, and tackle the pending tasks on my website. You've become my secret source of inspiration, and I find myself not even needing my Pre workout anymore.
            
            <br><br>There's so much more I'd like to say, but I'm holding back for fear of being cringe-worthy. However, I must confess to a rather impulsive act â€“ I've taken screenshots of  your Instagram photos. I apologize for not seeking your consent first. One of those pictures now adorns my wallpaper. I know it sounds terrible, and I promise I won't repeat it. It's my first time navigating these unfamiliar waters, and I'm learning as I go.
            
            I've never been adept at understanding or connecting with girls. My past as a chubby and overactive kid, followed by a phase of anger and avoidance during my high school years, left me with no close female friends. But now, for the first time, I find myself earnestly praying and striving to be a better person every day, especially for someone as special as you.
            
            Here's the heartfelt question that's been on my mind: Can you be my first and last female best friend I mean a best friend like friend frined ? I'm not well-versed in expressing these feelings, and it's my first attempt at such vulnerability. It's 5:11 AM, and exhaustion is setting in. Please, take your time to respond, and feel free to do so via Instagram DM. Goodbye for now, Princess Laveena. May the heavens always protect and bless you. </p>
